#ofxRemoteUI + Cinder Example

This is a small sanity-test project.

It's simplest to integrate RemoteUI through a Cinderblock, available at [github.com/kitschpatrol/Cinder-RemoteUI](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Cinder-RemoteUI)

Caveats:

- Untested on Windows.
- You might need to change the CINDER_PATH
- Several features are OF-only, such as the on-screen GUI and on-screen notifications.
